# What is Open Source and why you should care

The term Open Source Software reminds me of [Abraham Lincoln's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln#Gettysburg_Address_(1863)) widely accepted definition of Democracy. Lincoln said, "Democracy is government of the people, by the people, and for the people". Similarly, Open Source is **software** of the **community**, by the **community**, and for the **community**. Formally, Open Source refers to programs whose source code can be modified, shared and/or commercialized by the public/community at will. 
A license attached to an Open Source Software usually determines the extent to which the Software can be modified or utilized. More on licenses later
The degree to which such programs can be utilized or modified without restriction is usually determined by licenses attached to them. More on licenses later. 

Open Source is everywhere, the browser you are using to view this page is likely an Open Sourced one. The Android OS, Linux Kernel, Javascript are all examples of OS projects that are improved by people like you daily. As a developer, technical writer or designer; Open Source opens the doors to many opportunities; jobs, networking, communication skills etc. As a matter of fact, there is no hierarchy/ranking in the Open Source community. We  are all just contributors in the world of OS.

> **Note** : The term Open Source in this article will mostly refer to Open Source Software and Open Source in general ocassionaly.

## Where to find open source projects
If you are looking for Open Source Projects to contribute to, look no further than GitHub - the defacto home of Open Source projects.
GitHub is home to millions of Open Source projects. There are lots of projects that can align with your specialty if you know how to look.

## How to find open source projects
Finding Open Source projects to contribute to can be difficult, especially for a beginner. One of the reasons is because they are not looing in the right places. When it comes to contributing to Open Source, there are two problems beginners are often faced with:
- Finding projects to contribute to
- Knowing where to make changes or contributions in a project

##### Finding projects to contribute to
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click issues in the navigation panel
3. Filter the results by entering a keyword into the search panel e.g good first issue, help-wanted, JavaScript, technical writing, documentation, react etc
4. Search for something specific within your domain such as react, documentation, design etc
**good first issue and first timers only** are a labels for issues that are aprropriate for beginners to work on. Try these first if you are just starting out. 
5. Find an issue you would like to work on. If it hasn't been assigned to someone else, ask the maintainers if you can work on the issue and create a PR for it.
6. Alternatively, you can visit any of these websites to find OS projects worthy of your time:
-
These links contain thousands of issues that are suitable for beginners and experts as well.
7. > Note: Always make sure you go through the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files of a repository before creating Pull Requests. This will ensure that you adhere to the repositories guidelines for making contributions. Sometimes good PR's are rejected simply because the contributor did not follow the Projects rules. This could be something as trivial as not giving your PR an appropriate title or deescription. So be wary of this

##### Knowing where to make changes or contributions in a project

Believe it or not, knowing how to find bugs, errors, mistakes etc to files in a project is also a skill. If you go into a project's repo, you'll definitely spot an issue somewhere if you look closely enough. some of the most common issues you can find in repos include:
- Broken links in websites, project documentation etc
- Grammatical and Spelling errors
- Lacklustre designs
- Absensce of comprehensive documentation
- Absence of issue/PR templates in a repo
- Lack of contribution guidelines
- Lack of translation, a11y, [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) etc.

These are just a few off the top of my head. There are so many more areas in which you can consider for finding issues with a project. Just ensure that you do not open irrelevant or low-quality issues. Just bear this in mind before committing to any of these.
1. A good way to know if your issue is a quality one is to ask yourself this "how would this change or suggestion help/affect the users and maintainers of this project." If your answer does not sound credible to you, do not open such issue.
2. Always give benefits and reasonable explanations for your desire to introduce features, changes and corrections when opening issues. 
These are just a few which I've 

## What kind of contributions are legit?
Contributions to Open Source are not limited to Pull Requests only. Raising Issues, making Code Reviews, Financial Contributions are all ways of contributing to Open Source. Until recently, non-code stuff like blog posts, figma designs etc were not popular in the Open Source community. Things are beginning to change however. This year's [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com) which is accepting low-code and non-code contributions for the first time in 8 years is a good example of this evolving trend.
