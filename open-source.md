# What is Open Source and why you should care

The term Open Source Software reminds me of [Abraham Lincoln's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln#Gettysburg_Address_(1863)) widely accepted definition of Democracy. Lincoln said, "Democracy is government of the people, by the people, and for the people". Similarly, Open Source is **software** of the **community**, by the community, and for the community. Formally, Open Source refers to programs whose source code can be modified, shared and/or commercialized by the public/community at will. The degree to which such programs can be utilized without restriction is determined by licenses attached to them. More on licenses later.

Open Source is everywhere, the browser you are using to view this page is likely an Open Sourced one. The Android OS, Linux Kernel, Javascript are all examples of OS projects that are improved by people like you daily. As a developer, technical writer or designer; Open Source opens the doors to many opportunities; jobs, networking, communication skills etc.
