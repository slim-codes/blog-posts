# What is Open Source and why should you care

The term Open Source Software reminds me of [Abraham Lincoln's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln#Gettysburg_Address_(1863)) widely accepted definition of Democracy. Lincoln said, "Democracy is government of the people, by the people, and for the people". Similarly, Open Source is **software** of the **community**, by the **community**, and for the **community**. Formally, Open Source refers to programs whose source code can be modified, shared and/or commercialized by the public/community at will. 
A license attached to an Open Source Software usually determines the extent to which the Software can be modified or utilized. More on licenses later
The degree to which such programs can be utilized or modified without restriction is usually determined by licenses attached to them. More on licenses later. 

Open Source is everywhere, the browser you are using to view this page is likely an Open Sourced one. The Android OS, Linux Kernel, Javascript are all examples of OS projects that are improved by people like you daily. As a developer, technical writer or designer; Open Source opens the doors to many opportunities; jobs, networking, communication skills etc. As a matter of fact, there is no hierarchy/ranking in the Open Source community. We  are all just contributors in the world of OS.

> **Note** : The term Open Source in this article will mostly refer to Open Source Software and Open Source in general ocassionaly.

## Benefits of open source

Being a member of the Open Source Community brings many benefits including job opportunites, sponsorships, networking, improved communication skills, software integrity and much more. Job recruiters certainly love people who give back to the community, being a member of the OS community will boost your chances in getting a job because it shows that you are committed fostering new  relationships and working with others. Interacting with strangers outside your comfort zone will also improve your ability to communicate ideas effectively when working on projects. In the OS community, you are free to break things and make honest mistakes. Others will fix them and ensure that software is working perfetly.
With Open Source, even when you abandon a project. The community will keep it alive. This saves you a great deal of time to work on other projects. Some major benefits oF contributing to Open Source:

- Free Swag
- Networking and maing new friends
- It makes you a better coder/writer - People will correct you whenver you break stuff or find errors in your work

Imagine a world without Open Source. 

## Getting started with Open Source

Are you new to the Open Source Community? If your answer is yes, then you are in the right place. Even if your answer is No, there are a few tips that you can still take away from this post.

## Clearing up some misconceptions

- **Ability to code is necessary for Open Source**: Open Source is not limited to software, there are many low code/ no-code OS projects that you can find on GitHub today.
- **High technical skill is required to start contributing**: This is not true at all, simple changes like fixing typos, grammatical corrections, spelling errors are all welcome in the OS community as long as it adds value or improvement.

### Finding Open Source projects

Finding Open Source projects to contribute to can be difficult, especially for newcomers. One of the reasons is because they are not looking in the right places. When it comes to contributing to Open Source, there are two problems newcomers are often faced with:
- Finding projects to contribute to
- Knowing where to make changes or contributions in a project


If you are looking for Open Source Projects to contribute to, look no further than GitHub - the defacto home of Open Source projects.
GitHub is home to millions of Open Source projects. There are lots of projects that can align with your specialty if you know how to look properly. Follow these steps to find issues on GitHub

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click issues in the navigation panel
3. Filter the results by entering a keyword into the search panel e.g good first issue, help-wanted, JavaScript, technical writing, documentation, react etc
4. Search for something specific within your domain such as react, documentation, design etc
**good first issue and first timers only** are a labels for issues that are aprropriate for newcomers to work on. Try these first if you are just starting out. 
5. Find an issue you would like to work on. If it hasn't been assigned to someone else, ask the maintainers if you can work on the issue and create a PR for it.
6. Alternatively, you can visit any of these websites to find OS projects worthy of your time:
7. Many big projects often have abandoned or incomplete issues. You can find these by searching for "todo" or much issues which have not been fixed.
These links contain thousands of issues that are suitable for newcomers and experts as well.

### Knowing where to make changes or contributions in a project

Believe it or not, knowing how to find bugs, errors, mistakes etc to files in a project is also a skill. If you go into a project's repo, you'll definitely spot an issue somewhere if you look closely enough. some of the most common issues you can find in repos include:
- Broken links in websites, project documentation etc
- Grammatical and Spelling errors
- Lacklustre designs
- Lack of translation, a11y, [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) etc.
- Absensce of comprehensive documentation
- Absence of issue/PR templates in a repo
- Lack of contribution guidelines


> **Note**: Always make sure you go through the README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files of a repository before creating Pull Requests. This will ensure that you adhere to the repositories guidelines for making contributions. Sometimes good PR's are rejected simply because the contributor did not follow the Projects rules. This could be something as trivial as not giving your PR an appropriate title or deescription. So be wary of this

These are just a few off the top of my head. There are so many more areas in which you can consider for finding issues with a project. Just ensure that you do not open irrelevant or low-quality issues. Just bear these in mind before opening issues.

1. A good way to know if your issue is a quality one is to ask yourself this "how would this change or suggestion help/affect the users and maintainers of this project." If your answer does not sound credible to you, do not the such issue.
2. Always give insights to the potential benefits and of your added features, changes and corrections when opening issues. 

## What kind of contributions are legit?

Contributions to Open Source are not limited to Pull Requests only. Raising Issues, making Code Reviews, Financial Contributions etc. are all ways of contributing to Open Source. Until recently, non-code stuff like blog posts, figma designs etc were not popular in the Open Source community. Things are beginning to change however. This year's [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com) which is accepting low-code and non-code contributions for the first time after 8 years is a good example of this new trend.
